# Breadth First Search Analysis
This is an analysis of Breadth First Search. An algorithm typically used to find the shortest paths between two locations. This uses two different implementations of the algorithms. One utilizes Linked Lists and the other utilizes a two dimensional array.

__I have created my own data structures__ for personal learning purposes. In reality the actual algorithm would utilize JS structures and collections that are already built into the language.

## Running The Program
In order to run the program simply run the command
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have Node installed
3. Run the command `node index.js` from the command line.

## Altering The Program
Currently the program is not configurable from a prompt or a front end (I'm sorry!). I will try and get around to changing this in the future. But if you would like to run different tests with different graph sizes you will have to go in and alter the `index.js` file directly.

## More Information
Currently I have a small paper write up of the results between the differences betweent the two implementations. You can read the paper [here](https://github.com/WesleyAbbey/Algorithm-Analysis/blob/master/Assessment%20of%20Different%20BFS%20Implementations.pdf)
